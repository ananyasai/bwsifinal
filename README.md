Variational Quantum Classifier

- Developed a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) to improve credit card fraud detection by encoding data into quantum states and optimizing it with a custom cost function.
- Used a Kaggle credit card fraud dataset to benefit from quantum computing’s speed and accuracy over classical methods.
- Addressed implementation challenges, created custom encoding and auto-encoding, and optimized parameters using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).
- Showcased quantum computing’s potential to advance fraud detection and other complex data problems.
